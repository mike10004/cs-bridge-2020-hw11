# Question 2

Give a recursive implementation to the following functions:

## Part A

    int sumOfSquares(int arr[], int arrSize)
    
This function is given arr, an array of integers, and its logical size, arrSize. When called,
it returns the sum of the squares of each of the values in arr.

For example, if arr is an array containing [2, -1, 3, 10], calling sumOfSquares(arr, 4)
will return 114 (since, 2 2 + (-1) 2 + 3 2 + 10 2 = 114).

## Part B

    bool isSorted(int arr[], int arrSize)
    
This function is given arr, an array of integers, and its logical size, arrSize. When called,
it should return true if the elements in arr are sorted in an ascending order, or false if
they are not.
