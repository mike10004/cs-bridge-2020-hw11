# Question 1

Give a recursive implement to the following functions.

# Part A

    void printTriangle(int n)

This function is given a positive integer n, and prints a textual 
image of a right triangle (aligned to the left) made of n lines 
with asterisks.

For example, printTriangle(4), should print:

    *
    **
    ***
    ****

## Part B

    void printOppositeTriangles(int n)

This function is given a positive integer n, and prints a textual image of a two opposite right
triangles (aligned to the left) with asterisks, each containing n lines.
For example, printOppositeTriangles(4), should print:

    ****
    ***
    **
    *
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
